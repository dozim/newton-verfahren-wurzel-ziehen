# newton-verfahren-wurzel-ziehen

A simple implementation of the Newton Raphson square root.

## How to use

Create new NewtonRaphsonSquareRoot with
lastIteration = how many iterations you want => increases the chance of a successful approximation
precision = how many digits you want after the point
toSquareRoot = the value which you want the square root from
startValue = a number close to the result increases the chance of a successful approximation, for starters just use the same value as toSquareRoot
